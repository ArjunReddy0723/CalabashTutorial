Calabash Tutorial
==========
##Testing iOS App using Calabash

##Objective

Intent of this project is to illustrate how **Calabash** can be used to test iOS application

##This project illustrate below concepts:

###iOS App Test Automation
This would precisely explain how to get started with iOS App testing, write the first test and then evolving the same in test suite.

This java project has been created using **RubyMine (Trial Version)**. We have also bundled the iOS applications for ease. The original app you can find on Github repo of Mr. Mashhood Rastgar. Thanks a lot Mashhood for this brilliant test application.

The app is a collection of various iOS components like slider, menu bar, toggle etc and seamlessly works on iOS5, 6 and 7.

##Steps:

- **Project Set up** - Check out the project.

- **Calabash-iOS Set up** - Ideally you need to run three commands to set up the project. But majority of setup and other formalities are done, so all you need is to install the gems. So run the commands "gem install calabash-cucumber" from the parent directory and you are good. Open the project in Xcode and build the "-cal" taget of the application and then deploy on simulator. Verify once that the app is working fine.

- **Run the test** - In terminal, just type in "cucumber" and you are good to go. Watch out for some blogs on explaining Calabash and other stuffs related to it.

- **Chapters** - We have organised the repo in a way that you will chapters under features direcory. These chpaters are organised in a way that would help you progress from basics to advanced in Calabash.
